              User interface design is hard. With so many options to choose from
              regarding layout, spacing, typography, and colour, making design
              decisions can be overwhelming. When you add usability,
              accessibility, and psychology to the mix, it gets even harder.
              Luckily, UI design doesn’t have to be so hard. Over nearly 2
              decades working as a product designer, I’ve realised that most of
              my visual and interaction design decisions are governed by a
              system of logical rules. Not artistic flair or magical intuition,
              just simple rules. Having a system of logical rules helps you
              efficiently make informed design decisions. Without a logical
              system, you’re just using gut feeling to move stuff around until
              it looks pretty. I love rules and logic, but design decisions are
              rarely black and white. Rather than strict rules that you must
              follow, think of the following advice as helpful guidelines that
              work well in most cases.
